# Extenarcade: NES/SNES/N64/Gamecube/Genesis/Atari to Wiimote/NES Classic adapter firmware

This is a firmware for using a variety of controllers on a Wii/Wii U through a Wii remote. The NES Classic edition
is also supported.

## Project homepage

This is based on Extenmote
English: [Extenmote](http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/extenmote/index_en.php)
French: [Extenmote](http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/extenmote/index.php)

This derivative is for solder free connectivity (e.g. PCB already assembled) to install in arcade cabinets.

Schematics and additional information such as button mappings are available on the project homepage:

## Supported micro-controller(s)

Currently supported micro-controller(s):

* Atmega8
* Atmega168

Adding support for other micro-controllers should be easy, as long as the target has enough
IO pins and enough memory (flash and SRAM).

For N64 and Gamecube controller compatiblity, the micro-controller must be clocked at 12 MHz.

## Built with

* [avr-gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc)
* [avr-libc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/)
* [gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
